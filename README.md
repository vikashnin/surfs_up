* After analyzing the temperature summary for both June and December. The difference between the mean temperature of June and December is 4 degrees. Which isn't a drastic change and it can be concluded that the ice-cream shop will still be successfully year-round.
* The minimum temperature of June is 64 degrees while the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees.
* The maximum temperature between the two seasons are June 85 degrees and December 83 degrees.

## Summary
In order to have a more secure pitch. I believe we are able to gather more data for the area. I believe it will be benefical to bulid a shop in well-travelled areas, since alot of Hawaii business comes from tourism. We can also gather weather predications to help us determine if opening an ice-cream shop is a great idea.
